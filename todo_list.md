# List of ideas/things to to added, need improvement or need to be fixed

## To Add
  - option to pause and start animation see here [matplotlib docs](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/animation/pause_resume.html)
    needs matploblib version 3.4.2 which is only available for python 3.7
    (got some weird issues when I tried...)
  - logging, would be nice to have proper loggers for each component
  - proper config that is easy to use across code base and easy to save out
  - textboxes on figures to show live metrics
  -

## To Improve
  - pymunk ship-ice interactions
  -

## To Fix
  - after a long enough time running the simulation, a* search hangs and can't seem to find a path
    a possible solution would be a generation cap or a sort of timeout
  - path loop issue still occurs on occasion with the 16 heading primitives
